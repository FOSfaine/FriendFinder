# Friend Finder

### Description

This program is an approximation of a simple "dating app" to allow users to find new friends online by completing a short survey about themselves and submitting their profiles on the survey page. The program compares the new user's survey scores to the scores of other users who are in the database and suggests a friend with name and photo, with whom the new user might be compatible.

This app uses Node.js and Express server on the back end and Bootstrap CSS framework on the front end.

The Friend Finder app contains dependencies for `express`.
